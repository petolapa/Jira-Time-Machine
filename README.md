This is still a early protype. Jira Time Machine is an Atlassian Forge application designed to transform static project backlogs into dynamic "Future Simulations." By leveraging a simplified AI World Model framework, it helps Project Managers visualize the "Emergent Workflows" and hidden risks that traditional burndown charts often miss.

🚀 Key Features
Stochastic Risk Modeling: Uses Monte Carlo-style logic to simulate random "shocks" like team member sickness or unexpected absences.

Cognitive Load Analysis: Adjusts team velocity based on context-switching overhead and mental juggling costs.

Complexity Friction: Simulates the integration delays inherent in highly coupled or "spaghetti" codebases.

Real-time "What-If" Analysis: Interactive sliders allow users to see instant impacts on projected delivery dates for unresolved tasks.

Compact Dashboard UI: A high-density, professional interface built with Forge UI Kit 2, optimized for modern Jira environments.

🧠 Academic Foundation
This project serves as the practical implementation for a Master's Thesis at JAMK University of Applied Sciences: "Emergent Workflows in the Video Game Industry: Leveraging AI World Models as a Framework for Production Management."

It bridges the gap between software production theory (Context Switching, Coupling, and Aleatoric Uncertainty) and daily project management execution.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Atlassian Forge: Cloud-native development platform.

React: UI Kit 2 for native Jira look-and-feel.

Node.js: Backend resolvers for secure Jira API v3 integration.
